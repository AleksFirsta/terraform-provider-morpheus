# Authentication

The Morpheus provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for
authentication. The following methods are supported, in this order, and
explained below:

- Static credentials

## Static Credentials

!> **Warning:** Hard-coded credentials are not recommended in any Terraform
configuration and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a
public version control system.

### Username and Password

Static credentials using a username and password can be provided by adding a `username` and `password`
in-line in the Morpheus provider block:

```terraform
provider "morpheus" {
  url      = "https://morpheus_appliance_url"
  username = "admin"
  password = "password"
}
```

### Access Token

Static credentials using an access token can be provided by adding an `access_token` 
in-line in the Morpheus provider block:

Usage:

```terraform
provider "morpheus" {
  url          = "https://morpheus_appliance_url"
  access_token = "d3a4c6fa-fb54-44af"
}
```
